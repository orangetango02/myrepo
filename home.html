<font color="yellowgreen"><h3>Where I am From (CCHS)</h3>
<font color="yellowgreen">I am from Erieville, NY.  It is not a big town or city, but it is in the country
away from the civilization.  I went to Cazenovia High School.  Cazenovia High is a great school.  
But I thought it sucked when I was there.  I really miss it.  There were many teachers there that were weird or should I say unique.
Next year durring or after my 11th grade year, I will be going to NY and visiting Cazenovia.....  There were many people there that I would say need to be caught up on curent events or NEWS FLASHes<p>
Thanx to my friends in Cazenovia that have helped me through my time there!</font></font>
<h4><a href="http://www.caz.cnyric.org">Cazenovia Central High School</h4></a><hr>
<h3>Where I Went (LHS)</h3><p><font size=4>Now I am in Loganville, GA.  This too is not a big town
but it is bigger than Cazenovia.  I go to Loganville High School.  I have made a few friends here that have helped me adjust to my move,
but I have times when I can't shake the home sickness.  But I would like to thank these people that
have helped a lot.......<p>
Luann Byrd- Country as a hillbilly bumpkin' and has the world's bestest friend<br>
Abby Needham- Luann's best friend, absolutely  crazy and funny, Keeps Clayton out of all the trouble he seems to find<br>
Abby and Luann are just like my cousin Julie & her friend Heather.  Once they start laughing they can't stop!!  Abby & Luann thanx
for letting me in. <p>My Year has ended with LHS but now I will be going to Rockdale High School
