<h2>Some More?<br></h2><h4>
Kevin was born in Hawaii.  He moved around a lot, since his parents were in the service.  But, when I met
him we both lived in New York.  Saddly his parents have divorced and he went with his mom to IL.
(UPDATE) Kevin has moved back to NY with his Dad as of 4/1/00.  I love both his parents as I do my own.  I call 
them Mom 2 & Dad 2!  And of course I can not forget his sister Beth.  She is also unique.  She is very, very, very funny!
(LOOKING THAT IS) Just kiding.........  Him and Beth have a very close Sister-Brother relationship.
Just makes ya wanna PUKE!!!!!!!!  (also Joking)<br><hr></h4><font color="aqua">
<h2>What does Kevin do?<br></h2>
Kevin Likes to write songs.  I have looked at some of his songs and even heard them and they are really good.  He has a talent that if he uses to his ful extent will get him someplace. Me and him made a pact, "If either of us gets rich, we have to share the wealth."   He Better NOT Forget that! <hr>
<h2><font color="lightgreen">What is Kevin Like?<br></h2>
Well Kevin is very picky.  But music is his main thing.  He listens to music all day long in his room with headphones on.  One time I took a mirror that his mom had, (like the makeup mirrors that go in your purse) but anyway I took it and looked under his door and saw him dancing.... it was funny!!!!!!!!   For me anyway!</font>
