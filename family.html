<h2>My Mom & Dad</h2><h3>
Mom: Donna J. Shantal<br>
Dad: Brue E. Shantal Sr.<p>
My parents met in high school.  After they graduated they went their 
seperate ways.  My dad, sometime after
high school, got married and had two children.  Unfortuntitally the marriage did not last and they
got divorced.  Then my mom went out with a friend, to a diner/bar and my dad was also there.  
They met back up and started dating.  After a year my dad decided to pop "THE Question" in a parking
lot next to a baseball field in Munsville, NY.  They then had two children. </h3><hr>
